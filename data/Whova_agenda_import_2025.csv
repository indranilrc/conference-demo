This study presents a non-invasive method for real-time monitoring of brake oil degradation by detecting changes in water content using a single-electrode capacitive sensor based on a carbon nanotube paper composite (CPC). The sensor operates on the principle of fringing electric fields, enhanced by high-aspect-ratio carbon nanotube fibers that increase local field intensity and dielectric sensitivity. Unlike conventional two-electrode designs, this configuration offers structural simplicity and is well-suited for embedded automotive platforms. Experimental testing was conducted using two types of brake fluids, with incremental additions of deionized water (0.5% by volume) to simulate moisture-induced degradation. The sensor exhibited a strong linear response to increasing water concentration, with consistent slopes across fluid types, enabling a generalized calibration model for real-time water content estimation. The CPC sensor demonstrated high sensitivity, fast response, and excellent repeatability, making it an effective solution for in-situ brake fluid monitoring. This work supports the development of predictive maintenance systems aimed at improving vehicle safety and operational reliability</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4599/phmc_25_4599"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Yubin Cheon,,,Yubin Cheon; Changwoo Lee; Jae-Hyun Chung; Heung Soo Kim,,Sub,
2025-10-26 00:00:00,09:00:00,09:30:00,Doctoral Symposium,A Health Monitoring Framework for Thermal Degradation Mitigation in Solar Power Plants,Jupiter,"<p><i>Abstract:</i> <p>Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) of photovoltaic (PV) systems requires integrated approaches that link temperature forecasting with physical degradation modeling under thermal stress. This study addresses key limitations of existing PHM frameworks, such as the lack of high-resolution climate projections and limited coupling with degradation models, by proposing a unified PHM methodology tailored for high-temperature scenarios. The framework consists of three main components: (1) a formal problem definition of PV performance loss during extreme temperature and high cooling demand periods; (2) high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasting of temperatures; (3) probabilistic modeling of PV thermal degradation. The proposed approach integrates two<br>innovations, including a Gaussian copulaâ€“based risk assessment for capturing joint distributions of environmental stressors (e.g., air temperature, solar irradiance, and wind speed) and a Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (ST-GNN) architecture for accurate prediction of extreme temperature<br>events. Accelerated aging tests and ERA5 reanalysis data (1974â€“2023) have been used to parameterize the probabilistic aging models. Preliminary results from forecasting experiments achieved root-mean-square errors of 5.1â€“5.5Â°C across three representative Spanish climate zones. Future work will focus on enhancing the expressiveness of spatial dependencies through dynamic graph structures with learnable edge weights, as well as propagating predictive uncertainty from temperature forecasts into degradation models using uncertainty quantification techniques.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4580/phmc_25_4580"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Nadia N.

Therefore, it is essential to monitor the capacity degradation of the mobility battery and accurately predict the remaining useful life (RUL) from the early cycle stage. Particularly, RUL prediction is the main objective of the Battery Management System (BMS) and is important for guaranteeing the safety of the mobility system&nbsp;(Wu <em>et al.</em>, 2016)<strong>. </strong>&nbsp;This research introduces a hybrid deep learning model for RUL prediction, using LSTM-attention and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) methodologies. The proposed model uses statistical degradation features and domain knowledge-based features as input data acquired from the early 100 cycles of charge/discharge data of a lithium-ion battery. The model's performance evaluation was divided into two phases: primary and secondary, providing root mean square errors of 158.4 and 168.67, respectively. This study's results aim to contribute to the advancement of Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) technology, Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) strategies, and BMS-based life prediction technology for mobility battery systems.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4604/phmc_25_4604"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Kyutae Park,,,Kyutae Park; Heung Soo Kim,,Sub,

2025-10-26 00:00:00,10:30:00,11:00:00,Doctoral Symposium,Deep Learning for Robust Manufacturing: From Quality Control to Predictive Maintenance,Jupiter,"<p><i>Abstract:</i> <p>In todayâ€™s global manufacturing landscape, companies are required to balance speed, precision, and sustainability, thereby making intelligent, data-driven solutions a necessity. The convergence of Industry 4.0, cyber-physical systems and artificial intelligence technologies is leading to a new paradigm known as smart manufacturing, where the effective use of collected data can increase productivity, efficiency, and quality. This research explores the potential of deep learning to enhance industrial productivity by leveraging automated quality control of manufactured components and predictive maintenance of systems. Thus, this thesis focuses on two main objectives within an industrial context: (OB1) the development of models to enhance the quality control process, and (OB2) the development of models to implement a predictive maintenance strategy. These objectives are approached through three expected contributions. First, a quality control model for thermal images aligned with factory requirements (C1). Second, a contrastive learning model for anomaly detection in multiview images (C2). Third, a predictive maintenance model for die-casting molds (C3). Initial results are starting to show the advantage of these contributions to improve productivity in smart factories.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4577/phmc_25_4577"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Paula Mielgo,,,Paula Mielgo; Anibal Bregon; Miguel A.

We uncover dynamic stabilization mechanisms and quantify the energy barriers that retard lateral sliding, which are crucial inputs for physics-of-failure models. We combine ab initio density functional theory (DFT) and machine-learned-force-field Molecular Dynamics (MLFF-MD) for this study. Leveraging MLFFs allows us to extend our simulations to larger length- and time-scales and hence capture long-term dopant dynamics and degradation evolution. MLFF-MD has the advantage of combining a bigger scope with near-DFT accuracy, enhancing predictive capabilities for materials design.</p>_x000D_
<p>This work provides mechanistic insight into transition metal intercalation for 2D material's stabilization and offers a physics-informed computational framework for assessing material longevity and reliability. Such predictive capabilities are critical for proactive Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), enabling the rational design of robust 2D heterostructures, guiding synthesis strategies, and informing maintenance protocols for advanced electronic and spintronic devices.</p>_x000D_

However, developing reliable prognostic models in aviation is challenging due to strict safety requirements, limited labeled data, and the need for interpretable and trustworthy predictions. This research proposes a hybrid framework for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction that integrates multimodal domain knowledge available to airlines, such as sensor data, contextual information and reliability insights, into interpretable and uncertainty-aware algorithms. To this end, the proposed framework resorts to unsupervised degradation extraction with knowledge-informed autoencoders and supports extensions for failure mode segmentation. Initial experiments on a benchmark dataset show promising results, and application to real-world commercial aircraft data is planned to further validate the approach.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4605/phmc_25_4605"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Dario Goglio,,,Dario Goglio; Dimitrios Zarouchas; Manuel Arias Chao,,Sub,

We begin with developing the inherent motivation and desire for the inclusion of self-healing systems within space habitats: the problem with traditional methods of fault recovery and how they fail in a space habitat context. The intrinsic links between the concept of the self-healing system, Prognostics and Health Management, and affiliated areas of research are then shown to prove the relevance of this thesisâ€™ work to the PHM Society. The research plan is then laid out fully, beginning with the initial architecting of the baseline system of interest, generation of promising self-healing architectures, development of an analytical model to investigate faults, failures, and promising self-healing architectures, approaches to trade said self-healing architectures, and finally, showcasing how a selection process could be handled for a user-defined optimal architecture to be integrated within a habitat of choice. Preliminary results will be presented here. Finally, the novelty of the problem and approach is showcased specifically, along with contributions to the field of PHM, but also self-healing system development, and resilience engineering as a whole.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4637/phmc_25_4637"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Marc Koerschner,,,Marc Koerschner; Michael Balchanos; Dimitri Mavris,,Sub,

This requires balancing maintenance scheduling (MS), which drives downtime, with tail assignment (TA), which governs aircraft utilization. While recent research has explored the integration of MS and TA, these efforts have largely neglected the role of Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) and the uncertainty inherent in prognostic models. This research proposes a novel, unified framework that jointly optimizes MS, TA, and CBM using stochastic programming and health-aware models. The approach leverages sensor-derived prognostic information to forecast component degradation and incorporates its probabilistic nature directly into the planning process. By accounting for uncertainty in remaining useful life (RUL) predictions, the model produces robust flight and maintenance schedules that reduce the risk of unplanned disruptions. Preliminary experiments using real-world airline data demonstrate that explicitly modeling health uncertainty leads to more reliable scheduling outcomes, while improving operational efficiency and reducing maintenance costs. Compared to current industry practice, the integrated framework enables data-driven, future-oriented decision-making at the interface between fleet operations and maintenance planning. This work advances the state-of-the-art by holistically addressing TA, MS, and CBM within a scalable and interpretable optimization modelâ€”closing a critical gap in the practical deployment of CBM strategies in civil aviation.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4610/phmc_25_4610"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Benno Kaslin,,,Benno Kaslin; Marta Ribeiro; Dimitrios Zarouchas; Manuel Arias Chao,,Sub,

This research proposes a segmentation-driven framework that leverages a greedy Perceptually Important Point (PIP) algorithm to identify informative structural regimes in sensor signals without prior domain knowledge. A global reference signal is constructed from class-level Euclidean-barycenter averages, and consistent segment boundaries are applied across all samples. Segment-level statistical features are then extracted and used for classification. Evaluation on a chemical gas sensor dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional whole-signal summary statistics, achieving improved robustness to drift and unit variability. Future work includes parameter optimization of the PIP algorithm, exploration of class-sensitive segmentation strategies, and extension of the framework to remaining useful life (RUL) prediction and anomaly detection tasks.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4606/phmc_25_4606"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Dai-Yan Ji,,,Dai-Yan Ji; Jay Lee,,Sub,

Yet, decision-making often remains driven by the intuition of domain experts who rely on simplistic analyses and short-term considerations. This frequently leads to suboptimal decisions that fail to account for long-term effects, particularly in complex, interconnected systems. Current data-driven strategies typically focus on immediate objectives, overlooking relational structures and longer-term impacts. There is a growing need for more transparent, generalizable models that can simulate system behavior, reason about alternative future scenarios, and extrapolate to unseen conditionsâ€”capabilities that are essential for decision-making in Prognostics and<br>Health Management (PHM). This research aims to advance reasoning and decision support in PHM through three novel contributions: (1) a physics-informed surrogate model for simulating rigid body interactions, enabling the exploration of â€what-ifâ€ scenarios, (2) an object-centric visual reasoning model for dynamics prediction in sensor-limited environments, supporting visual inspection tasks, and (3) a neuro-symbolic framework for interpretable root-cause analysis in time series, improving diagnostic transparency and providing actionable insights.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4590/phmc_25_4590"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Amaury Wei,,,Amaury Wei; Olga Fink,,Sub,
2025-10-26 00:00:00,16:00:00,16:30:00,Doctoral Symposium,Integrating Few-Shot Learning and Pre-trained Models into Similarity-Based PHM using Small Data in Complex Engineering Systems,Jupiter,"<p><i>Abstract:</i> <p>Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) is vital for complex engineering systems, yet its data-driven solutions are often hampered by the ""small data problem""â€”a scarcity of labeled fault data in industrial settings. This limitation restricts the training and generalization of machine learning models and is compounded by varying operational conditions that reduce the relevance of historical data and pre-trained models. This research introduces a research framework to tackle these small data challenges in PHM. The primary objective is to develop a robust and adaptable PHM methodology by enhancing and synergistically integrating similarity-based Few-Shot Learning (FSL) with large-scale pre-trained time-series models. The research will focus on two main thrusts. First, it aims to improve the generalization capabilities of FSL frameworks by addressing limitations such as noise robustness, domain shift adaptability, and generalization to novel faults across diverse PHM domains. This involves developing noise-robust feature extraction, integrating domain adaptation techniques, and exploring expressive similarity metrics. Second, the study will investigate the effective adaptation of state-of-the-art pre-trained time-series models (e.g., TimesNet) for PHM tasks under data scarcity, focusing on efficient fine-tuning and synergistic integration with the enhanced FSL approaches. The author's prior success in a PHM data challenge using a similarity-based method for spacecraft systems provides preliminary validation. This research is expected to deliver an enhanced PHM framework for high-accuracy diagnostics with limited data, contributing generalized FSL models, systematic methods for leveraging pre-trained models in PHM, and advancing the practical deployment of intelligent PHM solutions.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4594/phmc_25_4594"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Takanobu Minami,,,Takanobu Minami; Jay Lee,,Sub,

Interest in nuclear power has grown in recent years, due in large part to the energy needs of advancing data centers, machine learning, and AI. Recent decades saw the premature closure of several plants due to economic challenges in the face of cheap natural gas. Operations and maintenance (O&M) represents the largest controllable day-to-day cost of producing nuclear power, and PHM provides an avenue to manage these costs. As we look to continue operation of our 94 operating plants, recommission previously shuttered plants, and build new reactors, there is a significant role for PHM to support the nuclear power industry. This panel will discuss current research and future trends for PHM in nuclear power applications. </p>

Traditional methods often struggle with generalization due to noise and speed variability. This work addresses these limitations by proposing a novel approach that leverages trends in vibration measurements over time and introduces a speed-normalized condition indicator. Building on prior work, we model the bearing fault signal as a periodic pulse wave and derive a Fourier-based representation that links harmonic magnitudes to spall size. We then introduce a normalization technique using harmonic speed ratios to eliminate the influence of the systemâ€™s transfer function. Experimental validation using controlled lab data confirms the methodâ€™s ability to preserve signal extrema and improve generalizability over different speeds, offering a promising path toward scalable, real-world bearing health monitoring.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4354/phmc_25_4354"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Cees Taal,,,,,Sub,
2025-10-27 00:00:00,14:15:00,14:45:00,Technical Papers,Prognostics of Rolling Element Bearings based on Cyclostationarity-based Indicators and Kalman filter under Varying Load and Speed,Evergreen C,"<p><i>Abstract:</i> <p>Rolling element bearings (REBs) are key components of rotating machines but the estimation of their remaining useful life (RUL) is still very challenging. First fault detection should be achieved as early as possible and then the RUL should be estimated as accurately as possible. Both steps require dedicated Health Indicators (HIs) which might not be the same when looking towards detection or prognostics. A key property of REB signals is cyclostationarity, as the statistical properties of their vibration behavior vary periodically over time. This characteristic has been effectively exploited to construct HIs for anomaly detection, and fault diagnosis in the field of condition monitoring (CM) achieving high performance. Although a plethora of methodologies have been proposed for RUL estimation, they usually are restricted in cases where the load conditions are assumed steady, reducing significantly their applicability and implementation in industry. Therefore there is a need for methodologies that are able to estimate the RUL of REBs operating under variable and/or varying load and speed conditions. The goal of this paper is the exploration of the performance of different vibration based HIs for fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis, including both time-domain and-order domain features. A dedicated bearing prognostics test rig was used to perform accelerated life tests of a self-aligned bearing, operating under varying load and speed conditions. The speed ranges from 0 to 3000 rpm and the load varies from 0 to 12 kN. The measurements lasted for around 400 hours and the bearing has an outer race fault in the loading zone. Different signals have been acquired during the tests, including accelerations, temperature and strain signals. The results indicate that the cyclic spectral coherence-based indicator is more sensitive to the change of states (healthy or damaged) and thus better for fault detection, while the correlation-based indicator is more sensitive to fault development, and therefore more suitable for the RUL estimation of REBs. Finally, to estimate RUL, different estimators, i.e., the Extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the Adaptive Kernal Kalman filter (AKKF), are used for RUL estimation.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4405/phmc_25_4405"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Zhen Li,,,Cees Taal; Dang Ngo-The; JÃ©rome Antoni,,Sub,

The test stand was equipped with a commercial magnetic filter, and a novel test process was developed to remove particles from the magnetic filter and suspend it in oil. In addition, oil samples were drawn periodically to analyze using LaserNet Fines. Both data-driven and classical vibration-based condition indicators were computed and compared to a simple, image-based feature quantifying of the surface condition with some of the indicators showing more than 80\% correlation.

Stage II addresses data scarcity and multi-target prediction using a Multi-task Shared Transformer. Furthermore, the model is optimized via a risk-aligned loss function that penalizes tardy predictions.

Accurate workload prediction is critical for optimizing user experience, safety, and performance in such settings. This study proposes a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with traditional workload assessment tools to enhance prediction accuracy in MR multitasking scenarios. A multitasking experiment involving 36 participants was conducted, combining real-world and virtual tasks, with workload evaluated using NASA-TLX. To address limited sample sizes, synthetic data was generated using generative adversarial networks (GANs), enabling robust model training. We employed a hybrid deep learning model that integrates LLM-generated text embeddings with numerical features in a feedforward neural network (FNN). Results show that integrating LLMs, specifically BERT and GPT-2, significantly improves workload prediction accuracy, with a root mean square error (RMSE) reduction from 6.82 (FNN-only) to 0.95 (BERT-integrated model). The findings underscore the potential of LLMs to augment cognitive workload assessment, supporting more adaptive and scalable human-machine collaboration in MR environments.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4408/phmc_25_4408"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",David He,,,Safanah Abbas; Heejin Jeong; David He,,Sub,

Predictive maintenance enables the identification of potential failure before they occur, improving operational efficiency, safety, and cost management by reducing downtown and optimizing maintenance scheduling. However, conventional approaches face three key challenges: lack of reliable run-to-failure data, uncertainties in system behavior and predictions, and fragmented processes between design and maintenance activities. This article introduces the concept of Authoritative Hybrid as-operated Digital Twin to overcome the current limitations. The proposed solution brings three main technical advancements: the integration of physics-informed Artificial Intelligence (AI) architecture reusing design artifacts into an IVHM system; the implementation of a comprehensive Validation, Verification, and Accreditation (VVA) process to support certification; and the enhancement of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) methods to ensure digital continuity across the different processes. This supports the development of advanced predictive maintenance capabilities, aligned with the vision of Type III IVHM systems, ultimately enabling more resilient, informed, and cost-effective operations in aerospace domain.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4343/phmc_25_4343"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Salvatore Norcaro,,,Salvatore Norcaro; Roberta Cumbo; Leonardo Mangeruca; Luigi Di Guglielmo; Alessandro Ulisse,,Sub,
2025-10-28 00:00:00,14:15:00,14:45:00,Technical Papers,Potential of Generative AI in Knowledge-Based Predictive Maintenance for Aircraft Engines,Evergreen I,"<p><i>Abstract:</i> <p>In recent decades, predictive maintenance has become a strategic solution to detect anomalies and anticipate failures in industrial equipment and sophisticated machines. This strategy relies on the continuous collection of multi-sensor data and performance indicators to feed machine learning algorithms capable of identifying early signs of malfunction, thereby enabling preventive interventions and reducing downtime. In the literature, three main approaches are described: physics-based, data-driven, and knowledge-based. Physics-based methods require accurate mathematical modeling of the physical degradation processes involved, but they are often difficult to apply to complex systems where physical laws are hard to formalize. Data-driven methods dominate current implementations due to their ability to learn complex patterns from large datasets. However, they suffer from several limitations, such as a lack of interpretability, dependence on large amounts of labeled data, and poor generalization to new operating conditions. Knowledge-based approaches, on the other hand, are more explainable and rely on expert-defined rules, but they struggle with adaptability and scalability in dynamic or uncertain environments.</p>_x000D_
<p>This study investigates the potential of generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) to address these limitations by supporting the creation of hybrid predictive maintenance models that combine the strengths of both data-driven and knowledge-based approaches. Generative AI offers new capabilities to simulate realistic failure scenarios, augment limited datasets, and extract structured knowledge from unstructured technical sources. It can also support the construction of domain-specific knowledge graphs or ontologies by identifying relevant concepts and semantic relationships, as well as generate logical reasoning rules based on expert input or technical documentation. Additionally, Generative AI shows promising potential in assisting the physical modeling of complex systems by proposing plausible approximations or surrogate models when traditional analytical modeling proves difficult. To support this investigation, the study will address a use case focused on Remaining Useful Life estimation for aircraft engines using the C-MAPSS benchmark dataset.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4352/phmc_25_4352"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Meriem Hafsi,,,Meriem Hafsi,,Sub,

Because PHM systems are not entirely like other systems on an aircraft, little guidance has been provided by the authorities or standards development organizations (SDO) in regards to such certification. Additionally, there is a lack of guidance for the continued airworthiness of the PHM system, i.e., rules for monitoring, maintaining, and updating them. We are not even touching on the ever sensitive topic of the need for significant monetary investment in the development, testing, manufacture, and operations of the PHM system, which OEMs are loath to do. However, there is some good news in the offing. One piece of this complex puzzle has recently been solved and in this paper, we will review and report on three events of significant progress which will help with the development and deployment of PHM systems for commercial aircraft.</p>_x000D_
<p>The MPIG (the Maintenance Programs Industry Group, which develops the maintenance guidance commercial aircraft â€“ MSG) published guidance on how a PHM task can replace an approved scheduled maintenance. Next, the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) published an advisory circular laying out the requirements for what an end-to-end PHM system needs to comply with to be deployed on aircraft certified in the US. But even more critically, the SAEâ€™s E-32 (Propulsion Health Management) technical committee published a short guidance on how to certify a PHM system â€“ and any required ground support equipment â€“ on an engine. The HM-1 (Integrated Vehicle Health Management) committee later updated this guidance to include the entire vehicle. With these three recent developments, one part of getting PHM systems on aircraft is made easier. Other challenges â€“ such as justifying them financially â€“ still remain, but it will be harder to argue that the certification and continued airworthiness authorities are not in favor of employing PHM systems in commercial aviation.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4368/phmc_25_4368"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Ravi Rajamani,,,Ravi Rajamani,,Sub,

Despite the maturity of this storage technology, the impact of capacity reduction due to battery aging remains a subject of interest to this day. This study presents a degradation model that computes the incremental loss of usable capacity for every equivalent cycle experienced by the battery. The model depends on the State of Charge values and the mean ambient temperature at which the cycle occurred. The methodology generalizes the results of a previous study where an initial degradation model was calibrated on longâ€‘term cycling data at which multiple commercial cells were driven to their end of life under varied state of charge ranges in addition to a chemical analysis of cell's degradation due to different operating temperatures. Unlike traditional calendar-plus-cycling additives or chemistry-specific semi-empirical methods, the proposed model is formulatedâ€”and further validatedâ€”under the assumption that cells exposed to comparable operating conditions degrade at comparable rates, independent of their electrode chemistry. Consequently, only the data of a single degradation campaign at a given operational mode is needed, which is typically found in the cell's datasheet, eliminating the need for time-consuming aging tests. Validation is performed using a public experimental dataset provided by the University of Stanford dataset. The results show the model's ability to predict the end-of-life within one percent of the reported battery State of Health (SOH), even for an electric vehicle usage profile. By embedding the framework in battery management systems, fleet operators can estimate remaining useful life (RUL) based on historical operational data, optimize battery usage based on less degrading SoC values and cooling systems, schedule preventive maintenance before catastrophic capacity loss, and compare alternative uses without the need for degradation studies. These contributions align with conference themes on prognostics, health management, and data-driven energy system optimization, offering a practical pathway towards longer-lived and better-valued electrified assets.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4373/phmc_25_4373"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Bruno Masserano,,,Bruno Masserano; Jorge E.

Accurate prediction of their Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is essential for ensuring reliable, cost-effective, and proactive maintenance strategies. However, conventional voltage-based Health Indicators (HIs) are highly sensitive to power fluctuations and fail to provide consistent degradation trends in real-world industrial scenarios, particularly when system usage varies significantly across different clients, as in the GEH2 case. In this paper, we propose a scalable two-stage framework for RUL prediction of PEMFCs operating under such conditions. First, we introduce a machine learning-based method to extract a degradation-specific Health Indicator directly from voltage measurements, effectively filtering out transient operational effects. Second, we develop a hybrid deep learning architecture that combines Transformer networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model temporal dependencies and provide accurate RUL predictions under dynamic conditions. The proposed approach is validated on a real-world industrial dataset collected from three PEMFC stacks deployed in GEH2 systems operating under highly variable conditions. Comparative results show that our method consistently outperforms baseline machine learning and deep learning models, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and generalization across diverse mission profiles.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4558/phmc_25_4558"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Phuc Do,,,Soufian Echabarri; Phuc Do; Hai-Canh Vu; Pierre-Yves Liegeois,,Sub,

However, in the case of electric vehicles (EVs), they often fail to incorporate critical electrical variables, such as battery voltage, power demand, and State-of-Health, which limits their applicability in operational planning and decision-making. This paper introduces a simulation platform tailored for EVs that bridges the gap between traditional transportation models and the needs of the PHM community in electromobility. The proposed platform combines power and energy consumption profiles derived from Gaussian Mixture Models with physics-based representations of battery behavior. Model parameters are calibrated using a publicly available dataset collected in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Each trip is partitioned into segments based on abrupt changes in speed, ensuring uniform operating conditions within segments and enhancing model transferability across routes. The platform simulates vehicle speed, electrical power demand, State-of-Charge (SoC), terminal voltage, and incremental capacity loss at each simulation step. Battery degradation is estimated through an empirical model fitted to long-term cycling data. A case study demonstrates the simulatorâ€™s ability to compare route alternatives between a shared origin and destination. Results show that the shortest path is not always the most energy-efficient nor the least degrading, highlighting the value of health-aware routing. The platform will be publicly released to enable reproducible testing of SoC estimation, range prediction, and degradation forecasting without requiring extensive instrumentation or prolonged field testing.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4370/phmc_25_4370"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Jorge E.

The MAYER (Multi-Sensor Assimilation Yielding Enhanced Reliability) project, part of the ARPA-E CURIE (Converting UNF Radioisotopes Into Energy) program, aims to develop a framework for tracking material loss in nuclear facilities by integrating multisensor data with predictive modeling. In this paper, we introduce MAterial Loss Tracking via Time Series Sketching (MALTS), a deep learning-based method designed to detect material loss events across the nuclear fuel recycling system. MALTS enhances the accuracy and robustness of nuclear material loss tracking by employing time series sketching to capture essential patterns while filtering out sensor noise, resulting in more stable predictions despite sensor noise effects. This approach also improves the time efficiency of material loss tracking by reducing the dimensionality of highfrequency sensor data, thereby enhancing computational scalability and enabling real-time inference. To further provide insights into the leak, MALTS ranks anomalous channels by post-processing results with a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) that considers the system flow diagram, generating a sorted list of anomalous channels from upstream to downstream. The initial leak location is identified as the first upstream channel. Experimental results demonstrate MALTSâ€™s effectiveness and efficiency in accurately identifying unseen nuclear material loss events and pinpointing initial leak locations, making it suitable for deployment within the MAYER digital twin framework for nuclear material safeguards.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4301/phmc_25_4301"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Hao Huang,,,Hao Huang; Scott Evans; Philip Honnold; Nathan Shoman,,Sub,

The study is part of a broader, high-level, modular Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) framework developed to predict Unscheduled Removals (URs) of the AJT horizontal tail flight control actuator. Operating in an industrial setting, this PHM effort specifically addresses the challenge of extracting prognostic information from a legacy fleet already in service, leveraging existing operational data to improve asset availability.<br>The overall project leverages an extensive real-world dataset that spans over ten years and more than 25,000 flight hours accumulated by a fleet of as many as 20 aircraft.

In this work, a systematic SOM hyperparameter tuning pipeline is also introduced. The tuning routine employs a combined grid and random search strategy to optimize the SOM hyperparameters by simultaneously evaluating the topographic error, the quantization error, and the percentage of grid utilization. The result of the application of the trained SOM on the dataset is a set of Clustered Mission Types (CMTs), each linked to specific statistical distributions of actuator usage increments. These clusters are integrated into the broader PHM framework to simulate future aircraft behavior and estimate component degradation.<br>Placed in an operational industrial environment, this methodology effectively connects mission-specific usage patterns with predictive health modeling, improving the fidelity of PHM systems, and laying the foundation for smarter usage-based maintenance planning in aviation operations.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4545/phmc_25_4545"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Leonardo Baldo,,,Leonardo Baldo; Andrea De Martin; Mathieu Terner; Giovanni Jacazio; Marcos E.

2025-10-28 00:00:00,16:30:00,17:00:00,Technical Papers,Deep Reinforcement Learning for Airplane Components Failure Prognostics Full Cycle Automation,Evergreen I,"<p><i>Abstract:</i> <p>As airplane components degrade over time, airplane service organizations (e.g., Boeing Global Services) and their airline customers need to collaborate on airplane components failure prognostics and replace/maintain components proactively to improve operation efficiency and reduce cost. In particular, airplane service organizations analyze various sensor data that captures the operational states of airplane components to predict possible component failures. Upon identifying an impending component failure, the service organization promptly sends alerts to the airline maintenance team. In response, the airline maintenance team conducts inspections and maintenance on the component and replaces it if necessary.</p>_x000D_
<p>In this airplane components failure prognostics procedure, machine learning or engineering-based models can be used to make predictions of components failure on each flight. However, it is crucial for airplane service organizations to determine when to send alerts to airlines given the predictions of the full history of flights. Late alerts may cause schedule interruptions or even grounding of the airplane waiting for parts. Early alerts can bring unnecessary inspections that lead to significant cost to airlines. Current solutions rely on heuristics and/or manual engineering reviews to make decisions on sending alerts, which requires significant manual efforts and is difficult to scale.</p>_x000D_
<p><strong>To improve efficiency of airplane components failure prognostics, we applied deep reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the prognostics procedure while enhancing accuracy of alerts timing. </strong>Specifically, we used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to represent alert policy that outputs alerts decisions based on flight sensor data and interaction history with airlines. To train the alert policy, we built a prognostics environment by using probability models to simulate airplane component state transitions over time and the airlineâ€™s feedback to alerts. With this environment, the parameters of alert policy are updated to minimize costs for airlines during the simulated prognostics procedure. This is achieved through the Deep Q-Network algorithm with memory prioritization to mitigate reward sparsity issue. Once learned, the alert policy is deployed to make decisions on sending alerts automatically by consuming incoming flight records and parsing current interactions with airlines. Moreover, we can fine-tune alert policy parameters to incorporate new airplane component features and airline operation changes. <strong>We conducted a case study on Boeing 787 air cycle machine (ACM) prognostics, which demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4397/phmc_25_4397"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Baoqian Wang,,,Baoqian Wang; Changzhou Wang; Denis Osipychev,,Sub,

These datasets are often manually classified â€“<em> in literature review papers</em> â€“ to assess their relevance for predictive maintenance applications. However, this manual approach is increasingly unsustainable, as it is time-intensive, prone to errors, and the accelerating pace at which new datasets emerge in both scientific and industrial contexts. To overcome these challenges, there is a growing need for automated solutions to curate, analyze, and categorize (tag) datasets in the literature. To this end, we propose and evaluate <strong>MAINTAG</strong> (Multi-Agent-based Predictive Maintenance Dataset Tagging System), a novel multi-agent system designed to automate the classification of predictive maintenance datasets. MAINTAG is compatible with any criteria-based taxonomy and is assessed by benchmarking its tagging accuracy against recent state-of-the-art literature. This evaluation highlights MAINTAGâ€™s ability to replicate expert-level dataset tagging.</p>_x000D_
<p>MAINTAG resolves three critical challenges in predictive maintenance dataset tagging. The first one arises from the dramatic increase in the number of datasets. The recent growth in predictive maintenance applications has resulted in higher data volume. This makes manual tagging methods impractical and unscalable. Researchers, therefore, will struggle to manually process this flood of new data. The second challenge is related to the complexity of data classification. Each dataset consist of different data types, sources, and structures. These create additional classification difficulties. The third challenge is keeping data tagging consistent across different domains. Predictive maintenance datasets come from multiple industries, and each has its own set of standards and/or classification criteria. MAINTAG proposes a specialized multi-agent framework in response to these challenges. The framework divides the complex classification tasks into simpler and more manageable parts. The system uses specialized agents working in parallel to handle different classification tasks. These agents work together to analyze different aspects of the datasets. This system marks a major leap in autonomous data tagging. It also sets the foundation for a more scalable approach for handling surge in the predictive maintenance datasets.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4369/phmc_25_4369"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Oguz Bektash,,,Oguz Bektash; Dorian JOUBAUD; Chetan.

When implemented correctly, product health management tools and processes can help lower total product ownership costs, improve safety, maximize availability and utilization rates, thereby delivering value to system operators and maintainers. Central to achieving this capability is robust data management that includes data acquisition, secure transmission, efficient storage and timely processing. These steps ensure that health insights can be delivered to stakeholders in support of diagnostics, prognostics, and informed decision-making.</p>_x000D_
<p>In sectors such as aerospace, defense and power utilities, the demand for high availability - targeting 99.9% uptime or â€œthree ninesâ€ â€“ places stringent requirements on product health monitoring systems. Hardware infrastructure, software, engineering processes and procedures are an integral part of achieving this target. This paper presents a focused exploration of the software, automation strategies, and best-in-class engineering processes that support high-reliability health data monitoring, with an emphasis on commercial aircraft engine applications. Drawing from Belcan Engineeringâ€™s experience, we highlight key software architectures, process improvements, and practices that enable scalable and maintainable solutions. Additionally, we discuss how early integration of health management capabilities into the development cycle enhances product value and reduces lifecycle costs. The insights presented are based on real-world implementations and are intended to guide practitioners seeking to build resilient, high-availability monitoring systems.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4357/phmc_25_4357"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Raghothama M.

We present a novel component-agnostic framework that unifies Health Indicator (HI) generation and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction through an integrated pipeline comprising: (1) advanced feature engineering, (2) unsupervised health baseline modelling, (3) monotonicity and trendability learning (4) probabilistic degradation detection with confidence-aware RUL estimation.</p>
<p class=""p2"">We validate our framework on two distinct Industrial Case Studies:Â Firstly, Tool wear monitoring in CNC machine using vibration and spindle current data collected from the real production machine. Our framework achieves early degradation detection of tool life<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">Â  </span>with RUL prediction within Â±15% of actual failure time. Flank wear (VB) was measured as a standard parameter for evaluating tool wear.Â  Secondly, bearing degradation assessment using the IMS bearing dataset.Â This validation demonstrates fault detection 40% earlier than traditional threshold methods with 90% confidence intervals.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Both case studies show strong HI monotonicity (&gt;85%) and reliable uncertainty quantification, establishing the foundation for scalable, explainable predictive maintenance solutions.

As this workforce ages and demand grows for digital tools, there is a growing need to capture and automate this knowledge while maintaining the precision required for technical applications. This study introduces an evaluation-driven framework for fault code recommendation, applied to a ground vehicle diagnosis system. Two tasks were designed to reflect potential system configurations: (1) a chat-style task simulating large language model (LLM) interaction, and (2) a label-constrained task using structured fault codes from technical manuals. Multiple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) configurations were compared against LLM-only and retrieval-only baselines. Results showed that retrieval-based methods outperformed LLM-based ones for label-matching tasks, while the chat task showed challenges in linking observations to fault codes from the manual. These results highlight the importance of aligning task design with evaluation goals and considering retrieval-first approaches as viable alternatives to LLMs in technical language processing (TLP) applications. Beyond experimental findings, we outline industrial lessons learned: the importance of aligning system design to use case goals, adopting evaluation-first validation, and the need to pilot LLM-based systems under realistic conditions. These lessons provide practical guidance for developing effective diagnostic support systems in industrial contexts.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4549/phmc_25_4549"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Sarah Lukens,,,Sarah Lukens; Matthew Bishof; Nadir Siddiqui; Destiny West,,Sub,
2025-10-29 00:00:00,09:30:00,10:00:00,Technical Papers,Semantic Framework for IT-OT Integration in Industrial Environments,Evergreen I,"<p><i>Abstract:</i> <p>This paper presents a semantic framework to bridge the gap between IT-OT integration in industrial environments. The proposed solution addresses fundamental challenges of PHM (prognostics and health management) by providing contextualized semantic information from the shop floor to enterprise IT systems. Built upon an OPCUA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) aggregation server architecture, the framework leverages OPCUA Information Models and companion specifications as its foundation for semantic representation. By transforming these models into knowledge graphs stored in RDF format, the system enables sophisticated semantic information retrieval through SPARQL-based semantic queries that can traverse complex relationships between equipment, processes, and operational parameters. The framework further implements GraphQL to automatically generate a Type schema derived from OPCUA types, creating a unified query interface that facilitates IT-like interaction with industrial data. This semantic approach significantly improves fault diagnostics, predictive maintenance, and anomaly detection by preserving contextual relationships that are often lost in traditional data integration methods. Furthermore, the GraphQL schema provides a structured foundation for generative AI applications to formulate contextually appropriate queries, extract relevant maintenance insights, and generate human-interpretable explanations of equipment health patterns, all while maintaining semantic fidelity across the IT-OT boundary. The vertical integration capability ensures that domain-specific models remain coherent across organizational levels such as line, area, floor, etc., enabling PHM practitioners to implement more effective condition-based maintenance strategies with improved visibility into causal factors affecting equipment reliability and performance.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4551/phmc_25_4551"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Anandrao Todkar,,,Anandrao Todkar; Mrinmoy Sarkar; Jitendra Solanki,,Sub,

However, continuous data requires large memory capacity and high costs. Therefore, in recent years, the use of event-based data for PHM models has become prominent and increasingly attracts attention due to its cost-efficiency and effectiveness. This surge in data availability has opened new avenues for developing data-driven methods that leverage event patterns to enhance diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive maintenance capabilities. Building meaningful and interpretable patterns from raw event data is crucial for understanding system behavior, detecting faults early, forecasting future failures, and accurately estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of critical components. This review paper systematically surveys the state-of-the-art methodologies and frameworks for extracting, modeling, and utilizing event-based patterns in the context of diagnostic and prognostic applications.&nbsp; Furthermore, we analyze challenges related to event data heterogeneity, scalability, and interpretability, as well as the need for robust pattern extraction methods that can adapt to dynamic operating environments. The review further explores how these event-based patterns contribute to building reliable diagnostic models, enabling early fault detection, and supporting maintenance decision-making through precise prognostics.Finally, this paper identifies key research gaps and outlines future directions, emphasizing the need for explainable, adaptive, and scalable pattern mining approaches that effectively translate raw event data into actionable maintenance intelligence. To address these challenges, we propose a conceptual framework that integrates advanced pattern discovery techniques with domain knowledge and feedback loops, enabling continuous learning and decision support. This comprehensive survey aims to serve as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners committed to leveraging event data for enhanced system reliability and the development of optimized, intelligent maintenance strategies.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4425/phmc_25_4425"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Phuc Do,,,Thi-Tinh Le; Phuc Do; Benoit Iung; Marcos E.

Applying CBM+ in the U.S. Navy faces a unique challenge: ships operate globally for extended periods, exposing machinery to a wide range of ambient air and seawater temperatures that alter their characteristic vibration signatures and can compromise model performance. This paper investigates the extent to which these seasonal temperature variations degrade the performance of a vibration-based fault detection model for a naval air compressor. Using data from controlled testing, vibration data was collected under healthy and various induced-fault conditions during both winter and summer to create two environmentally distinct datasets. Power Spectral Density analysis was used to extract features for training classifiers. Results show that models trained exclusively on data from one season performed poorly when tested against data from the other, confirming that environmental shifts significantly degrade predictive accuracy. In contrast, a model trained on a combined dataset incorporating data from both seasons demonstrated substantially improved and more generalized performance.

However, the presence of uncertainty and transient fluctuations in condition monitoring data makes the precise detection of degradation challenging. This paper presents a novel direct density ratio estimation (DDRE) method that computes the change score of the health indicator to detect degradation. The approach continuously computes the change score between two sliding windows using noise-assisted relative unconstrained least-squares importance fitting (NARuLSIF). This study does not rely solely on magnitude of the DDRE-based dissimilarity score; instead, it analyses the dynamic behaviors of the change score to categorize degradations into steady and progressive types. Additionally, this research identifies the onset of runaway failures, referred to as the initial degradation point (IDP), which is used as the starting point for remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. To validate the proposed approach, a publicly available rolling-element bearing dataset is utilized. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed DDRE method for both degradation detection and selection of the IDP.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4360/phmc_25_4360"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Sanjoy Saha,,,Sanjoy Saha; M.M.

However, direct inspection of internal gear componentsâ€”especially planet gearsâ€”is often infeasible due to the gearbox's enclosed structure and lack of documentation in aging or mixed fleets. This paper presents a methodology to estimate the number of gear teeth in bevel, sun, planet, and ring gears with fixed ring gear planetary gearboxes using vibration and tachometer signals. By applying Time Synchronous Averaging (TSA) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), we isolate gear mesh frequencies from noise and harmonics. Three case studiesâ€” UH60 Black Hawk, AS350, and Bell 407GXi main gearboxesâ€”demonstrate the application of the technique. For bevel gear estimation, TSA is performed using the input shaft rate, allowing dominant frequency peaks to reveal the gear mesh. In planetary gears, TSA is applied using the output shaft rate. Candidate mesh frequencies are identified, with harmonics and known gear interactions used to eliminate false positives. The most plausible planetary mesh frequency is used to estimate the ring gear tooth count, from which the sun gear tooth count is inferred using the total gear ratio.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4414/phmc_25_4414"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Changik Cho,,,Changik Cho; Eric Bechhoefer,,Sub,

This study investigates the potential of LLM agents to diagnose faults directly from raw sensor data, while producing inherently explainable outputs through natural language reasoning. Such explainability enables users to interpret and audit agent decisions and confidence levels with greater transparency. We begin by systematically analyzing how different agent configurations, such as centralized versus distributed agent setups, the ability to use computational tools for fault discovery, and the structure and scope of sensor input data impact fault detection accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Building on these findings, we then explore whether LLM agents can improve diagnostic performance over time through continual learning, calibrating their confidence based on historical ground truth outcomes. Through simulation-based experiments across varied degradation scenarios, this work aims to assess the feasibility of LLM-based agents as a foundation for transparent, adaptive fault diagnosis in real-world systems.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4350/phmc_25_4350"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Xian Yeow Lee,,,Xian Yeow Lee; Lasitha Vidyaratne; Ahmed Farahat; Chetan Gupta,,Sub,

Recent efforts to address this include few-shot learning, domain adaptation, and other data-efficient learning paradigms. However, while the use of pre-trained models has shown great promise in other fields such as natural language processing and computer vision, its application in PHM remains relatively underexplored. Although initial studies have begun to introduce foundation-style models for specific componentsâ€”such as recent efforts on bearing health diagnostics using transformer-based architecturesâ€”their development is still in an early stage compared to the maturity and versatility of large language models (LLMs) in the NLP domain. LLMs continue to advance rapidly, offering generalization capabilities that could be highly beneficial in data-constrained PHM settings. While some preliminary research has explored the use of LLMs as intelligent agents for decision support in PHM workflows, their application as direct learners for time-series sensor data remains rare. In this work, we propose a novel framework that adapts pre-trained LLMs for time-series-based PHM tasks. Our approach involves mapping temporal sensor signals to a tokenized format compatible with transformer-based language models, enabling the application of LLMs as generic sequence learners. Building on recent pioneering concepts such as multimodal LLM-based health management systems and prompt-driven signal encoding, our framework is benchmarked on publicly available industrial datasets under low-data conditions. The results demonstrate that our LLM-based approach not only maintains robust performance in scenarios with limited labeled data but also outperforms traditional models in fault classification accuracy. This study contributes a new perspective to the PHM community by highlighting the untapped potential of LLMs as general-purpose, pre-trained models in industrial health monitoring applications. Our findings suggest that incorporating LLMs into PHM workflows can be a powerful and forward-looking strategy to overcome data scarcity and improve adaptability across diverse operational domains.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4376/phmc_25_4376"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Takanobu Minami,,,Takanobu Minami; Dai-Yan Ji; Lee Jay,,Sub,

Among these, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a significant innovation, demonstrating strong capabilities in forecasting and representing the cutting edge of artificial intelligence (AI). Through transfer learning, LLMs effectively process and generate extended text sequences, and recent developments show their potential for multimodal integration, including text, images, audio, and video data.</p>_x000D_
<p>Quality management is a critical area for industrial innovation, rapidly evolving as manufacturers seek to close the quality-manufacturing loop and achieve zero-defect production goals. While computer vision techniques based on deep learning have been widely implemented for visual inspection tasks, integrating multiple heterogeneous data sources offers the possibility for even greater improvements. Despite the success of LLMs in language tasks, their application to time series data remains relatively unexplored. Alternative statistical approaches and deep learning models have proven effective for time series forecasting. Nevertheless, LLMs could provide additional advantages in industrial contexts, offering opportunities to enhance in-line quality control, defect prevention, and predictive discarding strategies across various sectors.</p>_x000D_
<p>This paper investigates the potential of applying LLMs to time series analysis by comparing the performance of an LLM (GPT-2), originally trained on textual data, with a model specifically designed for time series data (TimeGPT), and a more conventional transformer-based architecture. Our study includes a dedicated time series GPT model and a general-purpose LLM in a comparative evaluation. Through this analysis, we aim to better understand how language models can be effectively adapted to time series forecasting tasks and explore their transfer learning potential for enhancing quality management in manufacturing.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4407/phmc_25_4407"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",David He,,,Alessandro Tronconi; David He; Eric Bechhoefer,,Sub,

PHM technologies are therefore not only being deployed as retrofit solutions but are being integrated into new systems as standard practice. Deployment covers areas such as medical equipment, nuclear power plants, aeronautics applications, oil and gas, mining, and many others. As the impact of PHM increases, it is imperative to also consider the potential vulnerabilities that are being exposed. Hackers have famously used Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) systems to sabotage industrial facilities. As such, it is important to understand the exposure to malfeasance to ensure that PHM does not end up being the enabling mechanism for unauthorized access to the system it is meant to keep in running order. It is also important to understand the measures that need to be taken to avoid or respond to an attack. These range from extensive penetration testing to conducting extensive counter-social engineering training, setting up a PHM-specific CERT plan and team in place. This paper discusses various threats that are emerging and that may have to be considered when designing a PHM solution. Additionally, the NIST cybersecurity framework is discussed in the context of PHM. Finally, this paper looks at the diagnostic capabilities of PHM systems to detect cyber security attacks and to contain these threats.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4063/phmc_25_4063"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Kai Goebel,,,Kai Goebel,,Sub,

These approaches aim to optimize maintenance schedules, reduce operational costs, increase aircraft and assets availability, and enhance safety by leveraging Health Indicators (HIs). These indicators enable the monitoring of the aircraft health throughout its lifecycle, supporting the prediction of potential failures and proactive maintenance interventions. Consequently, a critical aspect of realizing the full benefits of CBM/PBM lies in the ability to accurately measure the performance of both predictive models and the operational performance of the equipment itself. However, the widespread and effective implementation of CBM/PBM faces challenges. Difficulties often arise from the inherent complexity of these systems and the need for efficient collaboration among stakeholders with diverse backgrounds and business objectives. In particular, the concept of ""performance"" can be interpreted differently by various stakeholders, leading to misunderstandings and hindering effective decision-making.Â <br />This paper addresses the limitations of relying solely on conventional operational metrics, such as the MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures), within a CBM/PBM context. It recognizes the necessity to move beyond traditional concepts and metrics associated with reactive maintenance and embrace a more holistic view. To bridge the gap between different perspectives, this work proposes an adapted framework that facilitates the reconciliation of diverse viewpoints. The proposed approach encompasses a detailed understanding of internal failure modes and the establishment of appropriate correspondence laws at equipment level. Ultimately, it seeks to foster stronger communication and understanding within the broader ecosystem of stakeholders, including suppliers, Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) providers, and end-users.<br />To achieve this, this paper introduces a set of new operational metrics as a paradigm shift, specifically designed for CBM/PBM environments. The MTBPR (Mean Time Between Predictive-based preventive Removals), which quantifies the time between preventive removals based on predictions; the NDF (No Degradation Found) rate, which measures the rate of early removals where no degradation was detected; the MLR (Mean Lifetime Reduction), which accounts for the reduction in equipment lifetime due to early removals. Importantly, the paper establishes clear analogies between these new metrics and the legacy metrics used in unscheduled maintenance strategies, namely the MTBUR (Mean Time Between Unscheduled Removals) and the NFF (No Fault Found) rate.<br />Furthermore, this paper delves into the crucial relationship between the performance of predictive models and operational performance. It demonstrates how typical data analytics metrics, such as Recall and Precision, can be effectively linked to classic equipment-level reliability metrics. By establishing these formal connections, this paper provides a generalized and robust approach to support the definition of performance objectives for predictive monitoring, and the way to properly monitor in-service performance (feedback loop). This approach fosters alignment and collaboration among all stakeholders involved in the CBM/PBM domain, ultimately leading to more effective and harmonized maintenance strategies and improved operational outcomes.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4311/phmc_25_4311"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Franck Dessertenne,,,Franck Dessertenne,,Sub,

While more complex means of assessing reliability exist, increased layers of complexity can lead to increasing difficulty when used to convince a military commander or fleet manager of the appropriate action to take. Furthermore, increased complexity increases the time required to produce, to <u>analyze</u>, and to assess results of reliability assessments. In a time-critical situation, when faced with the need for an immediate maintenance or engineering decision, the best information is that which is the simplest and easiest to understand, quickest to produce, and fastest to apply. In this work, a minimum list of data requirements will be developed with an associated means of <u>analyzing</u> these data to produce meaningful indicators to predict and to forecast unavailability and mission abort rates that can be used to plan for deployed or sustained operations. Analysis of the same data set can produce a prioritized listing of sub-system reliability degraders to drive engineering decisions for component improvement. The Royal Canadian Air <u>Forceâ€™s</u> <u>CT114</u> Tutor aircraft will be the basis for analysis demonstrating that sophisticated sensors and data systems are not required to be able to produce meaningful data suitable for significant fleet level decisions. Statistical methods and appropriate data filtering were applied to the engine system to derive rates for overall mission aborts, aircraft unavailability and aircraft unreliability for the top sub-system degraders. Conclusions drawn include that this information, if calculated correctly, can provide decision makers with the critical information required to make significant fleet wide decisions. Recommendations and methodology are presented that are applicable to any military or civil aircraft fleet at the sub-system, aircraft, and fleet level.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4315/phmc_25_4315"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Paul Bordush,,,Paul Bordush,,Sub,

Leveraging system-level data, the methodology adopts a multi-layered architecture grounded in systems thinking to classify devices as failed or non-failed and then identify the root cause domainâ€”hardware, software, or firmware.</p>_x000D_
<p>The first layer implements a meta-classifier that integrates multiple lightweight algorithms weighted by application-specific criteria such as accuracy, precision, or recall. This ensemble approach capitalizes on the strengths of diverse classifiers to enhance fault detection performance using high-level system metrics.

The results demonstrate that the method is not limited to the research subject but can also be applied to newly developed electrified systems, demonstrating continued applicability even when the target is changed. Next, we will provide an overview of the development of PHM method that can be used universally across electrified systems. In Phase 1, we identified key failure modes that could occur in electrified systems using FMEA, based on data collected from design, analysis, and testing. In Phase 2, we explored appropriate diagnostic methods for each failure mode. For gear failures, we developed rule-based indicators and verified their validity through experiments. For bearing failures, we also developed a rule-based approach to determine the presence of a fault. However, due to limitations in predicting the location of the fault, we re-evaluated the method based on data to confirm its validity. For failure modes, we used CAE analysis models to identify differences between normal and fault signals for eccentricity and demagnetization faults. Similar signal differences were also observed in the test results of the target product. Based on this, we were able to build a robust diagnostic model using only a small amount of experimental data. In Phase 3, we developed a device capable of data collection and edge computing capabilities capable of analyzing and diagnosing signals from actual vehicles, enabling the collection and analysis of the necessary data.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4399/phmc_25_4399"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Hong Suk Chang,,,Hong Suk Chang,,Sub,

Traditional inspection methods are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to inconsistency. Although deep learning approaches have been introduced for track monitoring, they typically focus on a single task, require extensive retraining for multi-tasking, and suffer from deteriorated performance when adapted to new tasks. There is a growing need for lightweight, real-time, and multi-functional solutions that can simultaneously detect rail components and segment rail surface defects without compromising accuracy or speed.</p>_x000D_
<p style=""font-weight: 400;"">To address these challenges, this paper presents RailNet, a lightweight and modular transfer learning framework tailored for real-time railroad inspection. RailNet integrates a frozen pre-trained component detection model and a new trainable module for surface defect segmentation. The trainable module refines feature maps from the frozen backbone and FPN through targeted correction and attention, introducing three key innovations: a Context Rebalancing Module (CRM) to offset pre-trained biases, a Selective Channel Attention (SCA) mechanism to highlight important channels to minimize computational costs, and a single-step Upsample Block for efficient high-resolution reconstruction.

The digital twin allows to connect sensor data from vehicles to railway assets and enables the development of custom algorithms for condition-based maintenance of railway tracks. For practical tests and validation of the digital twin, smartphones were placed in various trams and lightrail vehicles in the city of Frankfurt (Main) to record vibration and geolocation data over a period of more than a year. The results demonstrate that infrastructure quality changes can be automatically detected and monitored through the developed digital twin framework using a low-cost measurement set-up.

Recently, agentic frameworks have demonstrated significant potential for automating inspection workflows but have been limited to digital tasks. Their application to physical assets in real-world environments, however, remains underexplored.&nbsp;In this work, we propose a hierarchical agentic framework for autonomous drone guidance, focusing on visual inspection tasks in indoor industrial settings, such as interpreting industrial readouts or inspecting equipment. Our framework employs a multi-agent system comprising a head agent and multiple worker agents, each controlling a single drone. The head agent performs high-level planning and evaluates outcomes, while the worker agents reason over and execute low-level actions. Operating entirely in the natural language space, the framework follows a plan, reason, act, evaluate cycle, enabling drones to handle tasks ranging from simple navigation (e.g., flying forward 10 meters and land) to complex high-level task (e.g., locating and reading a pressure gauge). The head agentâ€™s evaluation phase serves as a feedback and/or replanning stage, ensuring the actions executed align with user objectives while preventing undesirable outcomes.&nbsp;</span>We evaluate the framework in a simulated environment with two worker agents, assessing performance qualitatively and quantitatively based on task completion across varying levels of task complexity and agentic workflow efficiency. By leveraging natural language processing for agent communication, our approach offers a novel, flexible, and user-accessible alternative to traditional drone-based solutions, enabling a more autonomous problem-solving approach to industrial inspection tasks without requiring extensive user intervention.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4328/phmc_25_4328"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Xian Yeow Lee,,,Ethan Herron; Xian Yeow Lee; Gregory Sin; Teresa Gonzalez Diaz; Ahmed Farahat; Chetan Gupta,,Sub,

However, traditional methods often rely on computationally intensive signal processing and struggle to detect subtle anomalies wave patterns. In this work, we propose a novel transformer-based framework, called Dual-Contrastive-Attention Transformer (DCAT), for unsupervised anomaly detection in Lamb wave data. DCAT uses two attention branches during training: a Global-Context Attention (GCA) branch that captures long-range patterns, and a Local-Context Attention (LCA) branch that serves as a constraint. A contrastive loss is used to prevent the global branch from over-learning local features, encouraging it to focus on the overall structure. Both branches are trained to reconstruct the input, using a structural similarity (SSIM) loss that better reflects waveform patterns than traditional mean squared error. After training, only the global branch is retained for inference. Anomalies are detected by comparing the input and reconstructed output. Since the global branch cannot easily reproduce local defects, it produces a higher SSIM loss when anomalies are present. We test our model on a Lamb wave dataset with multiple types of defects. DCAT achieves 97.8% accuracy and a precision of 98.6%, outperforming other SOTA baselines. These results show that DCAT is well-suited for accurate Lamb wave-based SHM without the need for labeled data.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4322/phmc_25_4322"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Yi Wang,,,Jiawei Guo; Boshi Chen; Sen Zhang; Nikta Amiri; Ge Song; Lingyu Yu; Yi Wang,,Sub,

The effective implementation of these mechanisms is crucial to ensuring both reliability and efficiency in modern manufacturing environments, where automation is increasingly integrated. Traditional anomaly detection algorithms typically rely on single-view data for each manufacturing product, overlooking relevant and complementary information available from multiple perspectives. Furthermore, cross-entropy-based loss functions are frequently adopted in the literature to train detection models; however, these approaches often struggle with imbalanced datasets or when detecting rare and subtle anomalies. In this work, a contrastive learning architecture for multi-view anomaly detection in industrial settings is proposed. The method performs a mid-level fusion to generate a structured representation of the input instances, thereby enhancing detection capabilities. The architecture was evaluated on the Real-IAD dataset, where it demonstrated better performance than traditional techniques. These findings highlight the potential of contrastive learning to improve anomaly detection performance, thus contributing to the construction of more reliable quality control systems in smart manufacturing environments.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4562/phmc_25_4562"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Paula Mielgo,,,Paula Mielgo; Anibal Bregon; Carlos J.

The data came from seventeen vehicles, each with an engine-related or a transmission-related maintenance event. The vehicles had months to years of sensor controller area network (CAN) bus data sampled at 1Hz. Separate autoencoder models were trained for each vehicle to improve detection sensitivity. The paper investigates several condition indicators (CIs) derived from autoencoder reconstruction error, each computed from a sequence of the reconstructionâ€™s mean absolute error (MAE). These CIs were compared using a performance metric computed as the area under the Pareto front with respect to normalized detection horizon and normalized baseline-relative CI margin. A novel detection procedure, consistent detection, effectively filtered out short-duration isolated spikes, likely false positives, while also increasing sensitivity to more plausible anomalies. In addition, the initial development of data-driven diagnostics, based on a novel approach of classifying full reconstruction error vectors associated with the fault state, showed promise but failed our robustness checks.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4359/phmc_25_4359"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Nenad Nenadic,,,Matthew Moon; Ethan Kohrt; Michael Thurston; Nenad Nenadic,,Sub,

Despite its potential, applications of SciML in prognostics remain limited, partly due to the complexity of incorporating partial differential equations (PDEs) for ageing physics and the scarcity of robust uncertainty quantification methods. This work introduces a Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework for probabilistic prognostics estimation. By embedding Bayesian Neural Networks into the PINN architecture, the proposed approach produces principled, uncertainty-aware predictions. The method is applied to a transformer ageing case study, where insulation degradation is primarily driven by thermal stress. The heat diffusion PDE is used as the physical residual, and different prior distributions are investigated to examine their impact on predictive posterior distributions and their ability to encode a priori physical knowledge. The framework is validated against a finite element model developed and tested with real measurements from a solar power plant. Results, benchmarked against a dropout-PINN baseline, show that the proposed B-PINN delivers more reliable prognostic predictions by accurately quantifying predictive uncertainty. This capability is crucial for supporting robust and informed maintenance decision-making in critical power assets.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4344/phmc_25_4344"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Jose Aizpurua,,,Ibai Ramirez; Jokin Alcibar; Joel Pino; Mikel Sanz; David Pardo; Jose Aizpurua,,Sub,

The proposed neural network aims to predict thermal runaway of a lithium-ion battery through prior temperature responses in real-time. The proposed neural network introduces three key features to provide an advanced control-enabling solution for battery thermal management systems (BTMS). First, the proposed neural network addresses the architecture of DeepONet as a surrogate model to effectively learn the internal temperature, chemical component concentration, and gas formation under supervision of complex and nonlinear multiphysics representing thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries. This approach enables accurate and robust virtual sensing capability even with limited data by constraining the prognostic responses to follow the governing equation of the underlying multiphysics. Second, a dual-network architecture is introduced to extract valuable features from prior temperature responses, which inherently contain limited information in real-time scenarios. The network comprises two sub-networks; the first network extracts latent features from decomposed temporal domains across diverse local domains, and the second network ensemble these features to original features for mitigate concerns on overfitting and generalization. This approach ensures effective supervision by stiff governing equations in both local and global domains. Third, novel methods are employed to reduce the training complexity associated with integrating multiphysics equations including separate DeepONet, stan activation function, adaptive weights, and encoders. These methods enhance the expressiveness of temporal and spatial gradients that play an important role in physics-informed neural networks. Hence, this feature not only ensures convergence through a balanced learning but also improves the overall capability of the neural network. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each feature, and thereby confirm the effectiveness of novel architecture and strategies in addressing failure issues in physics-informed neural networks. The proposed method enables real-time prognosis through prior thermal responses, offering a promising pathway toward artificial intelligence transformation in BMS to ensure the safety and efficiency of lithium-ion batteries.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4332/phmc_25_4332"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Jinho Jeong,,,Jinho Jeong; Eunji Kwak; Jun-Hyeong Kim; Ki-Yong Oh,,Sub,
2025-10-29 00:00:00,16:30:00,17:00:00,Technical Papers,Real-Time Fatigue Risk Assessment of BHA Connectors Using Combined Physics and Data-Driven Approach,Evergreen I,"<p><i>Abstract:</i> <p>Drilling operations depend not only on controlling surface parameters but also on keeping bottom-hole assembly (BHA) components structurally sound. The BHA is the lower portion of the drill string in a drilling operation â€“ the part that actually contacts the wellbore and guides the drilling process. Failures, especially at the connection between the flow diverter and the drive shaft behind the mud-motor power section, can cause major non-productive time (NPT), high costs, and poor performance. These failures are often linked to combined surface and downhole rotational speeds and high bending moments, which are common during directional drilling. To reduce this risk, we present a new method for real-time health monitoring and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation of these connections. The method combines physics-based fatigue modeling with machine-learning estimators, making it possible to track connector use across time and jobs using serialized component data. The system processes real-time drilling parameters to estimate downhole rotational speed (RPM) and bending moment. When measurement-while-drilling (MWD) data are available, direct RPM values are used; otherwise, a predictive model based on temperature, flow rate, and differential pressure is applied. Bending moment is inferred from drilling parameters and BHA design. The framework then calculates fatigue damage with connector-specific Sâ€“N (stressâ€“number of cycles) curves and updates both current and cumulative RUL values. This helps operators make proactive decisions and lowers the risk of expensive failures. Tests with historical drilling data show strong agreement between predicted damage and observed connector failures, proving that the approach works in the field. The solution is already integrated into a commercial platform and used by field teams. Case studies show it reduces unexpected failures, cuts non-productive time, and improves the efficiency of directional drilling.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4364/phmc_25_4364"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Dmitry Belov,,,Dmitry Belov; Yaou Wang; Wei Chen; Jennifer Gilliam,,Sub,

While most research has traditionally focused on improving the accuracy of RUL predictions, this paper argues that four essential characteristics, uncertainty, robustness, interpretability, and feasibility, are key for real-world PHM applications. This study explores these characteristics through a comparative analysis of two data-driven models (DDMs): the probabilistic Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model and the Adaptive Hidden Semi-Markov Model (AHSMM). Deep Learning (DL) models such as the BiLSTM often achieve high prediction accuracy but struggle with uncertainty quantification and adaptability across varying operating conditions. In contrast, stochastic models like AHSMM offer stronger robustness and feasibility, performing well even with limited or noisy data. Using the C-MAPSS dataset, the models are evaluated through the lens of the four proposed characteristics. This more holistic approach clarifies each modelâ€™s strengths, limitations, and practical trade-offs in PHM settings. The findings highlight that while accuracy remains important, focusing solely on it can overlook critical factors that affect model performance in real operational environments. Balancing all four characteristics is essential for deploying reliable and effective decision-making for predictive maintenance and operations.</p>

The framework utilizes data acquired from thermal Highly Accelerated Life Testing (HALT), replicating long-term material aging behavior under elevated temperature conditions within a shortened time frame. To address the high cost and time consumption of HALT experiments, the proposed approach aims to ensure accurate and reliable predictions even with limited data availability. An empirical degradation model is embedded within the PINN structure, enabling physically consistent and data-efficient estimation of degradation model parameters. The framework employs uncertainty quantification techniques based on Bayesian inference, in which data-driven approaches (e.g., Gaussian Process modeling, Bayesian neural networks) and physics-based methods (e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo, particle filtering) are separately applied to quantify variations arising from material properties, experimental conditions, and measurement noise. These methods generate posterior distributions from which failure time and probabilistic RUL estimates are derived based on a predefined degradation threshold. Compared to deterministic optimization methods, the proposed approach improves prediction robustness and interpretability, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for prognostic modeling in engineering systems.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4356/phmc_25_4356"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Jinhong Bang,,,Jinhong Bang; Minhyeok Choi; Hyeonseung Lee; Sangjun Jeong; Jaehyun Yoon; Jaehyeok Doh,,Sub,

In real industrial scenarios, a common challenge arises when the source domain contains multiple fault classes, while the target domain includes only healthy samples during training. To address this issue, this study proposes a unified industrial fault diagnosis framework designed to handle the partial domain adaptation problem. Specifically, the overall framework involves: a unified data processing pipeline, a robust deep learning architecture for accurate fault classification, and integration of maximum mean discrepancy loss to align feature distributions between source and target domains. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed partial domain adaptation-based deep learning model significantly outperforms benchmark models, achieving accuracy improvements exceeding 20% across multiple domain adaptation tasks.

Despite the widespread use of CFRP materials in various industries due to their favorable strength-to-weight ratio, the susceptibility to concealed internal damages necessitates advanced inspection techniques. Acoustic Emission, describing the use of ultrasonic waves emitted during deformation or damage events, is a proven and promising solution for real-time and reliable damage assessment. The study focuses on comparing two approaches: 1) a one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) for initial damage detection, followed by detailed damage classification, and 2) a direct classification approach using five classes (four representing the material specific damage types and one for background noise). Both approaches undergo a systematic evaluation under diverse loading conditions to assess their reliability. A comprehensive experimental setup subjects CFRP specimens to controlled loading conditions, inducing various damage types and severities. Signal analysis reveals characteristic patterns associated with different damage modes, including matrix cracking, fiber breakage, debonding, and delamination. The investigation considers the influence of loading conditions on the detection and classification results to examine the robustness of the approach. The comparison between methodologies involves established metrics and analyses the posterior probability of the trained models, considering the impact of loading conditions on performance. The experimental results show AEâ€™s effectiveness in detecting and classifying damages in CFRP structures, offering insights into technique sensitivity and specificity for different damage types. These findings contribute new knowledge to the NDT field, presenting a promising path for the advancement of CFRP structural health monitoring and maintenance practices in engineering applications. The studyâ€™s nuancedÂ  understanding of the strengths and limitations of the two classification approaches, considering loading conditions, contributes to the optimization of NDT strategies for diverse operation scenarios.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4346/phmc_25_4346"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Dirk Soeffker,,,Jonathan Liebeton; Dirk Soeffker,,Sub,

A NIOSH report highlighted 61 robot-related fatalities between 1992 and 2015, with an expectation of further rising due to the increasing use of industrial robots and cobots in the US work environment [3]. A recent study in [4] delved into 355 robot accidents documented by KOSHA between 2009 and 2019, revealing that 95% occurred in manufacturing businesses. Pinch and crush incidents accounted for 52% of the accidents, while impacts and collisions accounted for 36%, and the remaining 12% involved falls, flying objects, trips/slips, cuts, burns, etc. These findings align with US data reported in [5].<br>The rising integration of cobot units among major manufacturers emphasizes the critical need for enhancing cobot safety in manufacturing. Owing to safety considerations and regulatory requirements, existing cobots frequently operate at significantly reduced speeds and are restricted from undertaking complex interaction tasks in shared workspace. This limitation has curtailed the full potential utilization and productivity of cobots in manufacturing. This paper introduces a novel 3D sensing framework designed to address these limitations by enabling safety assurance in workspaces requiring close human-robot interaction. The framework generates 3D human pose information and relays it to the robot for real-time safety monitoring. Our methodology begins with data collection from a single RGB-D camera capturing human-robot interactions in a manufacturing environment. Human shape and pose are predicted using deep neural networks, which then incorporate depth information and undergo 3D geometric transformations to deduce size, shape, and translation. This process produces a reconstructed 3D avatar with pose, size, and location. Following 3D human posture estimation, this data is then integrated into a virtual environment with a real robot for real-time monitoring. Results demonstrate successful reconstruction of 3D human geometry within human-robot collaboration settings. By integrating both the reconstructed mesh and real-time robot state into a unified virtual environment, we achieved real-time, offline, continuous monitoring of the critical distance between robot and human throughout operation. These distance measurements provide crucial data for developing collision detection, prediction, and avoidance capabilities when incorporated into the robot control feedback loop.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4371/phmc_25_4371"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Tarek Yahia,,,Tarek Yahia; Kody Haubeil; Alex Suer; Yongzhi Qu; Janet Dong; Xiaodong Jia,,Sub,

In these processes, <br>maintaining precise material thickness and surface <br>uniformity is essential to ensure product quality, process <br>efficiency, and yield. While optical inspection systems are <br>widely used to detect surface defects, using AI to <br>automatically segment and classify the defect remains a <br>challenging task. This paper investigates a new <br>methodology to establish an AI powered optical <br>inspection testbed that automatically handles multi-label <br>defect classification and semantic segmentation in R2R <br>manufacturing environments. The proposed system <br>integrates semantic segmentation and multi-label defect <br>classification into an automated optical inspection <br>pipeline. Using a Vision Transformer deep learning <br>architecture, our classification model achieved a high <br>accuracy across multiple surface defect categories in a <br>production-representative dataset. Our framework <br>consists of automatic image pre-processing, rapid fine<br>tuning of pre-train vision models, and a continuous <br>learning strategy after the model is deployed. The system <br>is intended to handle high-throughput image data with <br>minimal latency, enabling fast and accurate product <br>inspection while maintaining a light-weight model <br>architecture. The end-to-end framework is designed to <br>enhance in-line defect detection, reduce human <br>dependency, and improve overall process visibility. The <br>proposed technology has been successfully deployed to a <br>manufacturing plan and has achieved satisfactory <br>detection and classification performance in a real <br>operation environment.</p><p><a href=""https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phmconf/article/download/4375/phmc_25_4375"">Full paper (PDF)</a></p>",Kody Haubeil,,,Kody Haubeil; Tarek Yahia; Alex Suer; David Siegel; Donald Davis; Xiaodong Jia,,Sub,
